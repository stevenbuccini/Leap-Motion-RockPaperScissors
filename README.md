Leap Motion RockPaperScissors
=============================

Play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer with your Leap Motion!

This project was built at a Leap Motion-sponsored hackathon at my school. This means that the code is still very buggy, and I no longer have a Leap Motion to test it.

Usage
-----
Download the Leap Motion SDK, then run gamelogic from the command line with the following command:

<code>python3 -i gamelogic.py

<code> >>> admin()
